<br>our project. The deep learning libraries which we going to use in our project and have live 
<br>experience in our department projects are TensorFlow, Keras, chainer, ONNX and pytorch, 
<br>we have practice keras and TensorFlow and explored its specification and features. In deep 
<br>learning environment this program has also covered one of the libraries named as FastAI 
<br>which has specification of AI related problems plus how to visualisation. The deep learning 
<br>environment is quite vast and while working with how we can manage our complier we 
<br>have also discovered that along with natural language tool kit, we have solved few queries 
<br>related to our project using natural language tool kit. The concept of computational layering 
<br>how we can manage them while working on our project, the importance of epochs, how 
<br>does they work, what is transfer learning and what roles it plays in data science society and 
<br>how it is important in the project we are working with. We have also introduced the 
<br>concept of maxpooling, google collab, Kaggle and fine-tuning. In this module they have 
<br>covered almost all the important aspect of deep learning and their tools and we have 
<br>experience how and what library can be used while working on the project I have assigned.

<br>this week while working on project I have explored CV2 libraries which use to classifier as

<br>collection process for which I have explored CV2 frontal face classifier and capture 100 more 
<br>pictures so we can have more data to work with, As presented to Mr. Ivan we have 
<br>discussed that this is an good approach for collection of data. The next step is augmentation 
<br>of keras, I have explored few keras applications like VGG16 for classification of data by using 
<br>VGG16 I have so far successful to train my model which is giving me quite good accuracy but

<br>project, in the first session of this week we have presented the updates on your projects 
<br>which was the one step up in the work of face recognition. I have successfully trained few 
<br>models over my data but also while discussing the issues facing, I have found out that I need 
<br>to try to use different approach and our mentor has shown us few different libraries which 
<br>are available and would be much easier to resolve the accuracy issues I am facing while 
<br>working on the environment. In the second session we have discussed the market of data 
<br>science industry and quite few insights of what and how we all can get ready ourselves for 
<br>the coming chapter of our lives and also while discussing on project we have resolved some 
<br>important issues related to CV2 libraries, also to go forward we have been assigned a task to 
<br>try use face recognition library which has C++ features and how we can integrate it with our 
<br>project to get better results and mark attendance in csv file.

<br>the personnel attendance in the csv file.

<br>working under professional data scientist mentor was the experience to get hands on 
<br>experience of all the theoretical work in professional environment.  
<br>By getting this opportunity I have come across to well written papers of projects related to 
<br>deep learning and machine learning and how we can label data and tools available like 
<br>Robocop which I have never experience before this program.

<br>and while working with big data set what challenges we can face and how to tackle them

<br>science and to practice those in professional light is what makes me get better insight of 
<br>those complex concepts where I have discovered they are quite interesting and easy to 
<br>practice and by working with ITIC  I have explored new ways to see the problem and where 
<br>to look for its solution which always been an hustle for me, while working with ITIC I have 
<br>learned the ways of communicating, presenting, how to make work relations, how to 
<br>differentiate between professional roles and how reporting hierarchy works, which was

<br></span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size:12px">make this program worth a while, as I am more incline towards visualisation of data and 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size:12px">reporting part of the analysis and how to control the specification of GPU and TPU was 
<br>something which I have never come across before this program. The managing of

<br>theoretical concepts, while working with python on anaconda and making our project looks 
<br>presentable is an integral part of work in our professional life. The explanation of analysis 
<br>and making them understand while using interactive tools caught my attention and there

<br>learn and this program met my expectation regarding that. I have learned how and to what 
<br>extend we need to pre-process our data set before running analysis on it. It gave me the 
<br>idea that we have to limit our pre-processing of data set otherwise it can interfere with the 
<br>outcomes and what basic procedure needs to be in mind while pre-processing of the data. 
<br>When it comes to work with neural network what procedures we need to take and how

<br>the data science industry and what roles of data scientist holds. They have provided us 
<br>learning environment without any judgments and my mentor always appreciate the idea of 
<br>participation in the session. While reviewing the training program he is enlighten us all the 
<br>complex concepts of data science in easiest way possible which was remarkable. In this past 
<br>couple of weeks, we have many discussions about professional life and career counselling 
<br>and which path I fit better to pursue in the future, on the other hand, Ms. Jennifer always

<br>a little while to confirm first which was a hustle in the start and trusting the organisation 
<br>with time was a little of the worry but still in this time the correspondence from the 
<br>education department was updated but I would say there is a room of improvement in 
<br>planning. Furthermore, I would like to highlight the interface of their website which could 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size:12px">be improve as being a tech company they should improve the interface of their website as 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size:12px">it’s not very appealing to me and it does need an update. When we talk about their training 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size:12px">program as I have come across it could get more better by adding some more advance 
<br>learning and if they can provide more material regarding their live project, it can help 
<br>students to learn more expand their skills. Their Linked in profile seems old which needs 
<br>new update and should work on it as being an freshie student to check the standard of the 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size:12px">organisation, the first thing we look into its organization’s LinkedIn profile. I believe these

<br>If I simply have any desire to rapidly filter the learning on the grounds that the player 
<br></span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size:12px">couldn&#x27;t do that. Additionally, if it’s conceivable you can recruit an addi</span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size:12px">tional a

<br>cannot have the option to provide regarding student issue promptly once in a while and that 
<br>can block a learning interaction. 
<br>I would also like to recommend they should work on their marketing as not many people 
<br>know about them while existing in the market for last ten years, they need a big marketing 
<br>team and few new big in date projects, collaboration with new clients and new services with 
<br>on board clients as these are big names of Australia which can help them grow as well.  
<br>It would be good if I can get a chance to have few sessions in the office which can help the
